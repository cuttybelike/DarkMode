PartC: Advanced Settings For User Interface

Unfortunately this is a poor video explaining how to access the advanced system settings in Windows10. Other than the horrible music playing in the background that takes away from his explanation, the video does provide a visual walkthrough on how to access the advanced feature in PC properties. The video also goes on to show how to configure performance options and gives a brief mention about task manager.[click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YseMMbeDB9M)

Here is a fun video showing how to change the new advanced settings system layout to the classic advanced settings layout for those who are nostalgic to the older versions of Windows. The video uses the windows11 and shows the setting where it can be reverted back to its original design.[click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d7jk8-iPfs)
